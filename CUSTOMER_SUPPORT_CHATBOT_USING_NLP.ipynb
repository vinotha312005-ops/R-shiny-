        "Customer support plays a vital role in improving user satisfaction and maintaining long-term relationships with customers. Traditional customer support systems rely heavily on human agents, which can be time-consuming, costly, and unavailable outside working hours. With the rapid growth of online services, customers expect quick and accurate responses to their queries related to billing, refunds, order status, and technical issues. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand and interpret human language, making it possible to build intelligent chatbots. This project focuses on developing a customer support chatbot using NLP techniques to automatically understand customer queries and provide relevant responses."

The project aims to classify customer queries into different intents such as billing issues, refunds, order tracking, and greetings. Another objective is to automate customer support interactions, reduce response time, and improve customer experience. The system also aims to provide accurate and consistent responses without human intervention."

        "\n",
        "The methodology begins with collecting a dataset of customer queries labeled with different intents. The text data is preprocessed by converting it into a machine-readable format. TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is used to convert textual queries into numerical feature vectors. A machine learning classification model is trained using these vectors to identify the intent of the user query. Once the intent is predicted, it is mapped to a predefined response. The chatbot is then tested using real-time user queries to verify its ability to understand and respond correctly. This approach ensures efficient and accurate customer query handling."
